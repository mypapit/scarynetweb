ScaryNet Web Filter - a test website for ScaryNet Convolutional Neural Network.

Scary Filter is a test harness which demonstrates the capability of ScaryNet in filtering scary images in web applications. In this demonstration, Scary Filter will blur an image suspected of containing scary elements. Scary Filter is written in pure HTML5 and Javascript to maximize portability across different platform and devices.

## What is ScaryNet?
ScaryNet is a compact Artificial Convolutional Neural Network trained to identify scary images. It is designed to be fast and light so that it could be executed on resource-constrained environment such as web browser, mobile device or embedded devices.
      
ScaryNet is trained using TensorFlow with Keras, and deployed with the help of TensorFlow.js library.

## Why ScaryNet?
- as an image filter for web sites or web applications.
- shield children from seeing scary images and previews.
- a module which can identify scary images and horror movies.
- plugin or extension for web applications such as WordPress, Joomla, Google Chrome, etc.
